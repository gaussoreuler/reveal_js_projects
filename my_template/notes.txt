The pores in porous silicon do not expand uncontrollably with each subsequent etching layer because of the **self-limiting nature of the electrochemical etching process**. Here's why:

### 1. **Current Flow Concentration**:
   - During the etching process, the applied current density controls the pore formation.
   - Once pores are formed, the current tends to flow preferentially at the pore tips, where the electric field is strongest. This localized field ensures that etching progresses deeper into the material, rather than widening the existing pores.

### 2. **Surface Passivation**:
   - The pore walls often become passivated during etching due to the deposition of reaction byproducts, such as a thin silicon oxide layer or fluoride-based compounds. This passivation reduces further chemical activity at the walls, limiting their lateral growth.

### 3. **Porosity Control Through Etching Conditions**:
   - The etching parameters (such as HF concentration, current density, and time) are carefully adjusted for each layer. These controlled conditions ensure that only the desired new layer is etched, with minimal impact on the already-formed pore structures.

### 4. **Layer-by-Layer Porosity Tuning**:
   - When constructing a dielectric mirror, the etching process is specifically designed to create alternating layers of different porosities. The new layer grows on top of the existing layer, with the porosity and pore size controlled independently for each layer.

### 5. **Structural Stability of Pores**:
   - Once pores are created, their structure provides mechanical stability, further resisting unwanted widening during subsequent etching.

By combining precise control of electrochemical etching parameters and the self-limiting behavior of the process, each layer of the porous silicon dielectric mirror is formed independently, maintaining the integrity and design of the underlying pores.

Neglecting oxidation during the fabrication of a dielectric mirror using porous silicon can significantly impact the results. Here's how oxidation might have affected your process:

1. Change in Refractive Index: Oxidation of porous silicon results in the formation of silicon dioxide (SiO2) within the porous structure. This conversion increases the refractive index difference between the oxidized and unoxidized areas. The overall refractive index of the layer could be lowered if oxidation is extensive, shifting the reflectance to higher wavelengths than originally planned.

2. Increase in Layer Thickness: The formation of silicon dioxide increases the physical volume of the silicon layer due to the natural expansion associated with the oxidation process. This increase in volume and thickness could explain why the total thickness of your mirror was more than twice the expected thickness.

3. Decrease in Electrical Resistance: As silicon oxidizes, the resulting silicon dioxide layers are insulating, which can initially increase resistance. However, partial oxidation might change the conductivity pathways within the porous structure, leading to reduced effective resistance over time, as you observed.

4. Non-uniformity in Porosity: Oxidation may not occur uniformly across the silicon, leading to variations in porosity and layer properties across the wafer. This non-uniformity can contribute to irregular optical properties and affect mirror performance.

5. Altered Chemical Dynamics: The presence of oxygen during the etching process might have altered the electrochemical environment, affecting etch rates and leading to unintended variations in porosity or layer thickness.

6. Reflectivity and Scattering: Another result of oxidation is increased surface roughness or imperfections, which can enhance scattering and reduce reflectivity, compromising the mirror's effectiveness.

Addressing oxidation involves either minimizing oxygen exposure during processing by using inert atmospheres or accounting for its effects in the design phase by adjusting the expected refractive indices and thicknesses to accommodate for potential oxidation. Regular monitoring of the oxidation state during fabrication can also help adjust parameters in real time to ensure the desired outcomes are achieved.
